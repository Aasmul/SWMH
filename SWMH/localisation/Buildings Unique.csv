ca_dannevirke_wall_4_desc;After a quiet period in the first half of the 10th century where the Franks and Danes were more concerned with fighting amongst themselves, the late half brought continued German pressure on the once again consolidated Danish realm. In order to repel Henry the Fowler and his son Otto the 1st, Gorm the old and Harald Bluetooth reinforced the main section with 5 meter high palisades supported by 20 meters deep earth banks and added a multitude of new sections, most crucially Margrethe’s wall, that finally would close the precarious gap between Dannevirke and the city walls of Hedeby.;After a quiet period in the first half of the 10th century where the Franks and Danes were more concerned with fighting amongst themselves, the late half brought continued German pressure on the once again consolidated Danish realm.
