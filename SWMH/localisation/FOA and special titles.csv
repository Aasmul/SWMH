The Duchy of Burgundy was in fact a part of France, so the royal chancellery avoided the term and the effective power of the Rector (in Roman law, a generic term for provincial governor) was restricted to the possessions of the Zähringer east of the Jura.;When William III, Count of Burgundy, was assassinated in February 1127, King Lothar III supported the claims of William's uncle, Duke Conrad of Zähringen, to the Countship, and conferred on him the regal powers over Burgundy.
